					<div><font size="2">I have been part of CyberScience at Emery CI since 2013. CyberScience is an enriched program at Emery CI in math, science and technology. This STEM program is meant for students with a special interest in Math, Science and Technology such as computer studies. Robotics is the mandatory technology course offered to them where a robot for VEX competition is built. These students are involved in integrated projects, special activities, and math and science contests that offered city and provincial level. They benefit from smaller class sizes (max 25), more individual learning opportunities, more "hand-on" activities and the opportunity to work with the latest technology. They plan activities that welcome the new grade nines every year as well as well as set up a presentation for grade eights interested to join CyberScience. CyberScience students are continuously involved in school leaderships at Emery CI and make the school much more active place to learn as well as have fun. Now serving as an occasional volunteer for certain events.</font></div>
